## 👋 About Me

I am a **Mechanical Engineering graduate from IIT Kanpur** with a strong research orientation at the intersection of **machine learning, natural language processing, and multimodal AI systems**. My work focuses on translating rigorous engineering foundations into modern, research-grade AI solutions.

I am particularly interested in **representation learning, reasoning with large language models, and applied ML systems** that operate under real-world constraints such as noisy data, limited supervision, and domain specificity.
